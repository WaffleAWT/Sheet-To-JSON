A simple tool I made in Python to convert ODS/ODF sheet files into JSON mainly my use is game development, behaves much like export sheet data extention for Google Sheets, but this one is local.

I use it with ODS/ODF files that are made in LibreOffice, it's an amazing open source Microsoft office alternative.

User guide:-

To download:
-Press Code -> Download ZIP
-Extract your file

To use:
-Locate the dist directory
-Open the executable inside
-Locate your sheet in the first tab
-provide a name and path for the JSON output

Wala :)
