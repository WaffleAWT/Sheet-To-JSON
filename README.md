A simple tool I made in Python to convert ODS/ODF sheet files into JSON mainly my use is game development in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), behaves much like [export sheet data](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/export_sheet_data/903838927001) extention for [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com), but this one is local.

I use it with ODS/ODF files that are made in [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org), it's an amazing open source Microsoft office alternative.

User guide:-

To download:
-Press Code -> Download ZIP
-Extract your file

To use:
-Locate the dist directory
-Open the executable inside "sheet_to_json.exe"
-Locate your sheet in the first tab
-provide a name and path for the JSON output

Wala :)
